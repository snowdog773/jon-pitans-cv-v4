                    <h2 id="about-me">About Me</h2>
                        <p>Former entertainment industry professional currently retraining as a full stack web developer
                        and Javascript developer. After many years working in the theatre and television industries, and 
                        a short career break to spend time with my young family, I have made the decision to embark on a 
                        new career in web development. After completing various online courses and tutorials I have now 
                        enrolled with a prestigious central London college to develop my skills to their full potential. I 
                        am hard working, keen, and have meticulous attention to detail. To see some examples of my work 
                        please visit the portfolio section of this site.

                <h3>Vintage Electronics Dealer</h3>
                    <h4>Self Employed Business 2015 - Present</h4>
                    <p>Running my own business selling vintage electronics and other vintage items via 
                    a variety of online marketplaces to customers all over the world. Responsible for all aspects of my business including
                    sourcing goods, sales ,customer service, logistics, accounting, marketing and a myriad of 
                    fixing and problem solving.
                    </p>
                <h3>Yard Supervisor</h3>
                    <h4>Keyline Builders Merchants 2014 - 15</h4>
                    <p>Responsible for overseeing all yard sales activities and driver deliveries. Managing a team
                        of two drivers and two sales assistants I was responsible for all yard sales, daily stocktaking,
                        housekeeping, driver delivery routes and loads, maintenance schedules for trucks, cranes, and fork lift
                        trucks, driver tachographs and FTA compliance. As well as this I was fire marshall, site manual handling
                        trainer, and liased with the regional manager to implement site health and safety measures.
                    </p>
               <h3>Props Assistant / Driver</h3>
                    <h4>Da Vinci's Demons Season Two - Starz / BBC Worldwide 2013 - 14</h4>
                    <p>This role involved working to support the art department of
                    this major television series. Handling mainly &quot;action&quot; props
                    such as swords, shields, and various other weaponry, I was
                    responsible for the safe transport of these often very valuable
                    items to and from sets, location shoots, and prop hire
                    companies.</p>
                    <p>It was also part of my job to read the script and produce a
                    breakdown of potential prop requirements cross referenced
                    with the shooting schedule to determine when each prop was
                    required. I would then compare notes with the storeman,
                    buyers, food hygienist, and props master to plan what was
                    needed when and if anything needed fabricating or hiring, and
                    make plans to ensure everything arrived on time.</p><p>
                    In television production it is imperative each department plans
                    its activities very carefully to ensure all requirements of the
                    shoot are fully met as even a few hours delay to a shoot can
                    cost tens of thousands of pounds. Working in the action props
                    team we took great pride in ensuring all our props arrived on
                    set on time looking perfect with no mistakes.</p>
                
                    <h3> Technical Stage Manager / Company Manager</h3>
                    <h4>Premier Stage Productions 2008 - 2012</h4>
                    <p>I worked for this company on a freelance basis touring the UK
                    and internationally with various theatrical productions, the
                    most recent being &quot;The Little Big Club Live In Concert&quot;, which toured the UK
                    and internationally between 2010 and 2012.</p>
                    <p>My responsibilities as technical manager were to oversee the
                    load in and construction of the set, to liase with the receiving
                    theatres technical crew to ensure our requirements for
                    lighting, sound, rigging, and AV were met &lpar;and if not to work
                    out a suitable compromise&rpar;, to carry out general maintenance
                    and running repairs of our equipment and order replacements
                    where necessary. During performances I mixed the front of
                    house sound, operated sound cues, and called lighting and AV
                    cues.</p>
                    <p>As company manager my responsibilities were to oversee my
                    team of 12 cast and crew, dealing with any issues or problems
                    they had while on tour, as well as handling disciplinary
                    matters. I was also responsible for looking after petty cash,
                    making purchasing decisions, hotel bookings, maintenance of
                    company vehicles, liasing with receiving theatres front of
                    house management, controlling stock levels of merchandise,
                    ensuring our merch was selling at its full potential, and
                    generally ensuring nothing happened to violate the license
                    terms of the characters in the show.</p>

                <h3>Surfing</h3>
                    <p>I first started surfing after hiring a board for a day on a holiday to Newquay
                        in the early 2000s and was hooked from day one, though for a long time being 
                        a land locked city dweller, opportunities to hit the water were few and far between.
                        Nowadays I am fortunate enough to live on the South Wales coast within easy reach of
                        many excellent surf spots and get out on the water as often as I can. Currently I use a
                        8 foot 6 Minimal type board which is well suited to the smaller swells we get in
                        this region.
                    </p>
                <h3>Paddleboarding</h3>
                    <p> I first tried Paddleboarding about 5 years ago when a local watersports club 
                        were offering taster sessions and I really enjoyed the experience of 
                        taking a board out on calmer water. So much so that I decided to invest in 
                        my own equipment and take up the sport. 
                    </p>
                <h3>Guitar</h3>
                    <p>Playing the guitar and music in general has been a lifelong passion of mine,
                        after first picking up a battered old acoustic at the age of 14. Over the years 
                        I have been in several bands and have been fortunate enough to perform in venues 
                        all over the country, I was even lucky enough to perform at the South by Southwest 
                        festival in Texas one year which was an experience I will never forget. 
                    </p>
                <h3>Woodwork</h3>
                    <p>One thing I really enjoy is making things. Particularly I like the idea of upcycling 
                        old useless into new things that either have a use or look nice. I prefer to use 
                        wood as it is easy and forgiving to handle and craft. I also ran a Youtube channel 
                        for a while about different DIY and building projects.
